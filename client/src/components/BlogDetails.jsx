Issue Faced:
While designing the Projects and Blogs section, I noticed that text became unreadable when users hovered over the cards.
The light text color combined with the light hover background caused poor visibility and bad user experience, especially in dark mode.

Solution Implemented:
To fix this, I changed the hover background to a darker shade (#393E46) instead of a bright color. 
I also adjusted the text colors during hover to maintain high contrast and ensure smooth transitions using TailwindCSS.

Technical Fix:
- Used bg-[#393E46] for hover backgrounds inside cards.
- Ensured text remains darker (like text-gray-300) for readability.
- Applied hover:text-[#222831] only on specific elements if necessary.
- Added transition-colors for smooth color changes.

Final Impact:
Now, Projects and Blog sections are fully readable and consistent across the portfolio, providing better UX, accessibility, and a polished design!
